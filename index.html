                </div>
                <p>👋 Hey! I'm <strong>Kai Karadi</strong>, a software engineer from <strong>Mountain View,
                        California.</strong></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>🏫 I'm currently a student at the<strong> University of Illinois </strong>studying <strong>Computer
                        Engineering</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    🧮 I'm passionate about high-performance computing, machine learning, and generative AI applications.
                    My favorite class this semester is <strong>ECE 385, Digital Systems Laboratory</strong> where we
                    have the opportunity
                    to learn <strong>System Verilog</strong> to program <strong>FPGAs</strong>. I will be continuing to
                    learning more about computing and methods to
                    accelerate the critical operations that support machine learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ☘️ At the same time, I have a strong foundation in software development and have had the opportunity to
                    work on many amazing projects. Alot of the work I have done has concentrated on applying Generative
                    AI models in creative ways. At my latest position at the
                    <strong>National Center for Supercomputing Applications</strong> I've been developing a backend for
                    a nutrition app with the ability to pull nutrition data from pictures with a built a
                    chatbot to give you nutrition recommendations. I've also lead a team of iterns to integrated an image
                    generation models for a novel webgame, and built a custom ai image editor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    🈺 Lastly, I've been deeply interested in business and entrepreneurship. I'm currenlty a consultant for
                    the on campus <strong>FACES</strong> consulting group. Some of my favorite experience from my past
                    internships came from analyzing our clients use of the tools we made, and thinking deeply about how
                    we could make it more engaging.
