                            <p>

                                I’ve had two work experiences with software development. One was working as a contractor
                                for a small private crypto investing community that wanted custom software tools
                                developed for their community. I worked in a small team of four and helped make tools
                                that would help track NFT prices, and would alert community members when an desired NFT
                                was listed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In my second work experience I helped make a nutrition chatbot that could interact
                                directly with your meal history at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Both fields were and are incredibly “hype” driven. The strongest claims made by
                                proponents of both technologies change fundamental parts of how society is structured.
                                Crypto proponents will say that the monetary control that governments have in the
                                current age will soon be untethered from governments and soon be run by algorithms that
                                trade computational work for currency. Or that X thing can soon be democratized when put
                                on a blockchain. On the other hand AI proponents say that exponential AI self
                                improvement could make intelligence that is so vastly superior to any form of natural
                                intelligence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is also reflected in the markets as investors flock to crypto and AI tech stocks as
                                a place to put their money into in hopes of striking it rich. In an article by Goldman
                                Sachs called “AI stocks aren't in a bubble” describes some of the concerning effects AI
                                has on market concentration. In their report they explain how 7 tech stocks currently
                                account for a 31.3% concentration in the market, more than that of the Tech bubble of
                                the 2000s, Japanese financial bubble, and the Nifty 50 bubble (1973).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having done some work in both fields I’ve had some time to think about how we look at
                                new arising technologies and really understand the expectations of what value can be
                                created from these technologies when every person in the room has widely different
                                expectations for these technologies. At the end of the day, no one can predict the
                                future but the following are the principles I’ve used to guide myself in understanding
                                where I may go.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first principle I always try to apply is what I call, “learning the fundamentals”.
                                Taking the time to understand the fundamentals behind the technology. When I had first
                                encountered the inner dissonance that was working in crypto where half of the members
                                say it will revolutionize the world and the other half say that it is a complete scam I
                                went to learn the fundamentals. I read the original bitcoin white papers and learned
                                about what the mathematics behind hashing were and how they created blockchain
                                technology. And I concluded that it was an incredibly interesting proposition. The
                                technology itself was novel and solved an incredibly complex issue of how you can create
                                ownership without a central authority. But it also came at a big cost. It was a trade
                                off of decentralization for more energy expenditure and friction. But this allowed me to
                                think more critically about all the applications people would say would be
                                revolutionized by crypto and allow me to analyze them for myself. For one some people
                                claimed crypto would be the future for a company's internal database. I knew that this
                                was completely unrealistic as one company would have very little reason to not have a
                                centralized authority when a company itself is often structured in a centralized
                                hierarchy. It also let me think more critically about the more realistic applications of
                                these technologies. Often, proponents of a technology will not dwell on the costs and
                                inefficiencies using said technology will incur but by understanding the fundamentals I
                                could add a bit more insight.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I ended with the opinion that the technology itself was quite interesting but that
                                crypto
                                more often than not seemed to be a solution looking for a problem. And that in the
                                current
                                state most of crypto was speculative with very little value offered in the means of the
                                technology itself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second principle I always try to apply is to actually use the thing in as many
                                interesting ways as possible to see for yourself what it could do. Given the tumultuous
                                relationship I had in understanding crypto when I saw the AI hype train coming up again
                                I
                                was skeptical. It looked very similar with similar promises and similar disagreements.
                                But
                                what was different about AI was that I could actually use it to get work done. ChatGPT
                                was
                                free to the world and at the cost of purchasing a couple tokens could easily be baked
                                into a
                                software project that one might be working on incredibly easily. And so I could run
                                experiments and see for myself what AI could be used for. And I found it to be quite
                                compelling. At a hackathon I used AI to create a language conversation partner where you
                                could create a custom scenario and talk to the AI in a different language. This could
                                definitely be used to have conversations when a native speaker couldn’t be found. At my
                                current position I ran hundreds of tests running the latest chatbots against a battery
                                of
                                user meal histories and queries to see how deep the insights were in regards to
                                nutrition,
                                and compare it to actual nutritionists answers. And I found that, though it wasn’t
                                perfect,
                                it was enough to justify further exploration. I even remember one time where both our
                                nutritionist and Ai recommended the exact same foods and had incredibly similar
                                predictions
                                of a user's daily caloric intake.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The last principle I had was understanding expectation. The reason different people have
                                such widely different reactions to technology may not just be because they see the
                                technology differently but because they have different expectations of such a
                                technology.
                                And the elation they gain is simply the difference between expectation and reality. For
                                me
                                that was something that was easy to forget. It seemed that the perspectives of people
                                were
                                mostly based on their understanding or misunderstanding of a technology but I believe
                                now
                                that it's mostly on what they expect from it. AI is incredibly revolutionary technology
                                but
                                as Goldman Sachs explained in their article AI is incredibly capital intensive from a
                                hardware and energy perspective. For AI to pan out it can’t just be good. It must meet
                                the
                                incredibly high expectations set in the markets. I also think the article by the Harvard
                                Business Publishing Don’t Let Gen AI Limit Your Team’s Creativity illustrates this
                                perfectly. They found that on average Gen AI would produce better ideas but would
                                produce
                                exceptional results less of the time. For someone expective AI to be a captain in their
                                company this may be disappointing but for someone using AI to act as a conversation
                                starter
                                it's incredibly powerful. Your view is not so much shaped by the technology but what you
                                envision and expect from it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All in all, much of this is still guesswork as the future is impossible to predict. But
                                by
                                using these three principles I like to guide myself in understanding balancing
                                expectations.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For this blog post I wanted to reflect on one of the guest speakers of my Technology and Management Seminar class, Dr. Moran. During his lecture he brought up an incredibly interesting perspective on text that I believe is incredibly relevant to the next generation of technologies and that was the idea that text is computable. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During the lecture Dr. Moran would show the use of different NLP tools being applied to CEO’s letters where we could see these techniques coinciding with real world events. For example when the average sentiment of all CEO letters was measured it was clear that during 2008 many of these sentiments dropped in Industries greatly affected by the recession. At first glance this seems incredibly obvious until you consider how difficult of a task this is for a program to accomplish. Extracting sentiment from an algorithmic perspective, before the advent and wide adoption of AI, was incredibly difficult. The sentiment of one word is modified so much by its context so when creating a model of the sentiment of each word the context must be considered quite carefully. The example Dr. Moran gave the word “execute”. In a historical context this would probably be used negatively, describing grim executions. Yet in the business context this word is actually quite positive, the do a task swifty with poise and precision.
                            </p>  
                            <p>
                                The reason the concept of text being computable was so attention grabbing to me was because of my research where I am in a team that is trying to create a food recommendation algorithm that is able to recommend foods that you like but are healthier than your current diet. And the main issue we were having when developing this algorithm was how do you quantify food. At some point each food had to be translated to some set of numbers that could be compared with other foods to find their similarity yet for food there were so many different angles I could take it. 
                            </p>  
                            <p>  
                                The first angle that we had considered was to represent food by its nutritional make up. If you’ve ever looked at the back of a nutrition label there's always a fixed set of nutrients that the government enforces must be listed on a food label. These are well documented and could easily translate each food into these numbers but the question was whether these foods would appear similar to each other. Just because two foods that have similar amounts of salt didn’t say anything about cuisine, taste and a whole category of how we associate food.
                            </p>  
                            <p>  
                                Food could have been thought of from the perspective of ingredients. If I could list every ingredient in the world, and find how much each food used for each ingredient I could get some semblance of similarity. But the challenge is how do I find a list of every ingredient in the world? Is an ingredient even a fixed set of things or does it change depending on the context. And where would I have gotten a clean source of data on the ingredients for every food.
                            </p>  
                            <p>  
                                Finally, I tried a semantic approach. Similar to Dr. Moran, I went to the word itself, with the concept that text is computable. Using a new AI technique called vector embeddings, I could translate any word into a set of numbers that somehow captured its semantic meaning. This is in fact a major step in how Large Language Models like ChatGPT process text. These embedding vectors work in a way that is able to capture semantic meaning, within the numbers itself. An example is the equation where we subtract and add the vector embeddings for Man, Women and King like follows King-Man+Women=Queen (https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/09/17/166211/king-man-woman-queen-the-marvelous-mathematics-of-computational-linguistics/). By subtracting Man from Women, the vector embeddings were able to derive a vector that in some sense represented gender, and by adding that to Queen we could change the gender of the word to King. Again, text has now become far more computable with the rise of new AI technologies.
                            </p>  
                            <p>  
                                Using this I was able to get the semantic meanings for all foods in the form of numbers and compare them with other common foods to find a description of how closer they were. And this approach worked quite well. Yet even then there were some strange effects where the cuisine of the food mattered more than the type of food. So a Japanese noodle dish would always be classified closer to a Japanese fried food than a noodle dish from another cuisine. And this brought up interesting questions about what foods people want to recommend in the first place. Are they seeking foods similar in cuisine or in type of dish? We are still working through these issues but the ability to compute text now is incredibly interesting.

                                I find it interesting, comparing the techniques that Dr. Moran used it for his thesis with the current state of NLP. In just a few years analysis went from rudimentary algorithms of meticulous work calculating the average sentiments for a word depending on the context, to now fully numerical descriptions of objects that somehow encode meaning. I find it incredible that the most advanced intelligent systems we currently have are based on our incredibly messy world of language and I find it such an interesting problem of trying to decode language and use it for useful tasks like recommending healthier foods that people actually will try.
